### Fortnite Scraper

[Fortnite Scraper](https://github.com/calebling/webApp) is a personal hobby
project that I built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3. This web app scrapes
for Fortnite player data from [Fortnite Tracker](https://fortnitetracker.com/)
to allow for player performance comparisons.
